# 🔍 Hackerrank:Python Program to Check if a String Ends with a Numeric Digit

This Python program checks whether the last character of a given input string is a **numeric digit (0–9)**.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that checks if a given string ends with a number using Python's built-in string methods.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Start the program.**
2. **Input** a string from the user.
3. **Access** the last character using indexing (`string[-1]`).
4. **Check** if the last character is a digit using the `.isdigit()` method.
5. **If true**, print that the string ends with a number.
6. **Else**, print that the string does not end with a number.
7. **End the program.**

## 💻  Program
```
string = input()
if string[-1].isdigit():
    print("String ends with a number")
else:
    print("String does not end with a number")

```
## Output
